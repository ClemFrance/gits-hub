## My process
  First I created a class name called parents which Nest everyother element in the body tag,then inside it contains a div with class name 'container'which holds only the image and the text div
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Text Styles

### What I learned
  I learnt some HTML and CSS properties and what they does and how they can be applied in a website e.g CSS text properties

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css parent{
    background-color: aquamarine;
    width: 1000px;
    height: 700px;
    margin: 120px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 25px;
    position: relative;
}

.container{
    background-color: white;
    width: 230px;
    height: 390px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 18px;
    margin-left: 20px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

}
```


### Continued development

  I would prefer to continue focusing on learning Responsive HTML and CSS and building Projects so as to increase my confidence and by doing that be able to handle any kind of challenge
